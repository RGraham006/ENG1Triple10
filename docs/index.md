##Website Changes
Team 27 (BlackCatStudios) has taken over Team 30's (Triple10) website and game.
The website was previously made up of html documents. Team 27 decided to convert the documents to markdown and use material for mkdocs to build the page. 
This has been done because the team already had experience with mkdocs as we used it for our website for assessment 1 and because html can be used directly in markdown.
Mkdocs provides useful functionality which make the website easier to create and use.
